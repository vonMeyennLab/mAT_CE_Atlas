## Folders

- [scripts](https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/AT_memory/tree/main/ChromHMM/scripts): Scripts to run ChromHMM
- [tracks](https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/AT_memory/tree/main/ChromHMM/tracks): Enhancer tracks for adipocytes



## Workflow
ChromHMM was used to identify enhancers for adipocytes. We selected a state that was enriched for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac but not H3K4me3.
